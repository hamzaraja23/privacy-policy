Privacy Policy for CelQ

Effective Date: [10/20/2024]

Thank you for choosing CelQ. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our application. By using CelQ, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

At CelQ, we prioritize your privacy by minimizing data collection and processing. We do not store, save, or process personal data beyond what is required for essential functionality. For instance, we may collect certain usage data during your session to ensure seamless functionality, but this data is not retained or saved once your session ends. We do not store any personally identifiable information, nor do we collect persistent logs or save any data associated with your use of CelQ.

Because we do not retain your data, we do not sell, rent, or share it with any third-party services beyond the immediate, temporary use required for essential app operations. If we use third-party services for necessary functionalities, they are bound to handle data only as needed and in line with our strict privacy standards. CelQ operates in compliance with legal requirements for security, but given that we do not retain any personal data, no identifiable information is accessible through our app.

CelQ may include links to third-party applications or services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those external sites, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they handle your data.

CelQ is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently gathered information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it promptly.

We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes, with the effective date shown at the top. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at Hamzaraja825@gmail.com
